# Project Portfolio
This is a collection of projects that I have done throughout college. Please view the PDF's for more information.

## Senior Design: Indoor Navigation With Smartphones (In Progress)

**Team Website:** http://projects-web.engr.colostate.edu/ece-sr-design/AY18/navigation/

**Problem:** While GPS is great at locating a device outdoors, it has trouble penetrating the roofs of buildings, providing an inaccurate location.

**Solution:** Predict the location of the user by using KNN machine learning algorithm and Wifi.

**Results:** In Progress


## Weather Prediction (In Progress)

**Goal:** To create a simplistic weather prediction network with Raspberry Pi, multiple Arduinos, temp/humidity/pressure sensors, and Exponential Moving Average algorithm.

**Results:** In Progress


## Occupancy Monitor (Fall 2017 - Spring 2018)

**Report Fall Symester:** https://github.com/LaneSBarnes/Portfolio/blob/master/Occupancy%20Monitor%20Part%201.pdf

**Report Spring Symester:** https://github.com/LaneSBarnes/Portfolio/blob/master/Occupancy%20Monitor%20Part%202.pdf

**Problem:** Occupancy limits set by fire code is hard to recognize and enforce.

**Solution:** Infrared cameras positioned above a room's entrances will use basic image processing to count people coming in and out. A master-slave connected through wifi will synchronize all cameras and display the total amount of people.

**Results:** Accurately counted people coming in and out of the BC-Infill during the E-Days demo.


## Glove Controller (Spring 2017)

**Report:** https://github.com/LaneSBarnes/Portfolio/blob/master/Motion%20Capturing%20Glove%20Controller.pdf

**Problem:** Manual control of external robotic claws/grabbers can be difficult.

**Solution:** Glove with flex sensors placed behind each finger joint will track the full range of motion of the human hand.

**Results:** Gloved moved each ligament of 3D modeled hand created in Unity.


## Automatic Attic Fan (Fall 2017)

**Report:** https://github.com/LaneSBarnes/Portfolio/blob/master/Automatic%20Attic%20Fan.pdf

**Problem:** Most attic fans are manually turned on or off.

**Solution:** Using CMOS transistors, thermistors, and relays, a fan can be activeted when a certain temperature is reached.

**Results:** When exposed to hot air from a hair dryer, the fan would activate, enter a state of hysteresis, and then deactivate when the thermisters fall below the lower threshold temperature.


## Programmable Lock (Spring 2016)

**Report:** https://github.com/LaneSBarnes/Portfolio/blob/master/Programmable%20Keypad%20Lock.pdf

**Goal:** To create a programmable keypad lock that can store user-made passwords.

**Results:** 3x4 keypad and LEDs are wired to an Arduino. The Arduino controls a servo which opens a lock.
